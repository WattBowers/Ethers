# Ethers


## Details

This project is built using React and Typescript. it is a test demonstation of the Ethers.js library. It is a basic app but it shows off some of the core components of the Ethers library, that being the ability to query the blockchain, and send transactions. This app is integrated with the MetaMask wallet to send test transactions to other wallets over the Kovan test network. 

### What I learned

The big takeaway from this mini project is how Etherium and other blockchains interact with code. Using the Ethers library it is made very clear how to manipulate and inquire about the state of the blockchain, and how to send transactions to validatiors and use them to write to the blockchain. 

This project also helped cement the fundementals of typescript into my mind. I learned how to create and modify types to work with different libraries and reasources. And I learned how to do some tooling of the configuration files to have more control over the typescript enviroment. 

### Getting this to run 

To get this to run on your own machine, you will need to clone the code, run npm install, and use npm start to run it on your localhost.
